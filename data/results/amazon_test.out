The face masks worked perfect for the school project .
  I would buy again from US Toy .
The eye holes were teeny tiny for our big adult eyeballs .
I think
these are for children .
So
if you are tiny ,
or a kid ,
these masks are for you .
Otherwise , get yo self another mask .
Perfect for our Girl Scout troop
who made masks for their masquerade ball
Order was true to the description .
Material could be better
but overall , nice enough for a kid 's party .
My fault !
I should have purchased the ones
I bought in 2003
Looked for inexpensive masks for one event
and these worked well .
I was looking for child size masks for my class
to decorate
and these were a perfect .
  The fit was just right
( the kids were able to see
and they did not fall off )
  and decorations
( feathers , sting , gems )
were able to be attached with glue sticks .
  Most importanly thye stayed glued on .
  If you need to create masks for children
this is a perfect choice .
